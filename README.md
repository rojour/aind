Projects developed while taking the Udacity Nanodegree in Artificial Intelligence.

The projects are in python. Developed from files started from the instructors where we need to complete parts of the project.
The uploaded files are the ones that were submitted for grading. I am sure that they can be improved, however they meet the standards and at this point, that was the goal.
